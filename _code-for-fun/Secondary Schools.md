#### The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme for Secondary Schools complements existing MOE Computing Education efforts in secondary schools, such as the Computing-related Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) as well as the O-Level (elective) Computing subjects.

The programme offers a 10-hour curriculum which
* focuses on computational thinking concepts including their application in the real world and in coding;
* incorporates elements of making and design prototyping through the use of microcontrollers; and
* reinforces students’ understanding through exposure to practical project work.
* Two programming tracks, namely, Block-based programming and Text-based programming, will be available under the programme.
IMDA and MOE HQ will fully fund the training cost of 1 lower secondary school cohort (i.e. either Secondary 1 or Secondary 2) per year. Participating secondary schools will also be fully funded for the required supporting microcontrollers and accessories, subject to terms and conditions.
