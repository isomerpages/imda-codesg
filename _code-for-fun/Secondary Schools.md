### Code for Fun Enrichment Programme for secondary schools complements existing MOE’s Computing Education efforts in secondary schools, such as Computational Thinking infused curriculum and Computing-related Applied Learning Programmes.

From 2023 onwards, the programme is enhanced to include the following:
* Schools have the option of either the Vendor-run or School-run model:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;**o** Vendor-run: Vendor delivers student training and hardware. IMDA and MOE HQ funds student training and hardware.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**o** School-run: School conducts comparable student training programme. Vendor delivers hardware, funded by IMDA and MOE HQ.
* Better integration with schools’ Applied Learning Programmes (ALP) via ALP-theme student projects.
* Inclusion of emerging tech via project themes, hardware such as AI camera and SLS module developed by IMDA.


The programme continues to offer a 10-hour curriculum which:

*   focuses on computational thinking concepts including their application in the real world and in coding; 
*   incorporates elements of making and design prototyping through the use of microcontrollers;
*  reinforces students’ understanding through practical project work; and
*  includes two programming tracks, namely, Block-based programming and Text-based programming.

       
IMDA and MOE HQ will fund the training cost and/or hardware cost of one lower secondary school cohort (i.e. either Secondary 1 or Secondary 2) per year, subject to terms and conditions.

**Application Details**

All MOE Government and Government-Aided secondary schools are eligible to apply for this programme.

Application for 2023 has closed.  Application for 2024 will open in **October/November 2023**.
