### Photo Essay Competition 

#### Title: NAOv6 Robot to the Rescue! submitted by Digital Artisans Club 

##### **The Journey**
##### 
Our group of Primary 6 students embarked on the Emerging Tech X VIA project.

Through the completion of this project, they would become the tech ambassadors for emerging technologies.
The students were extremely excited to embark on the project.

The project started off with a virtual workshop by the instructor on Social Robotics. The students were exposed to how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be applied in a variety of settings to engage with people and impact their lives.

*"I enjoyed this VIA project. I like how I can make use of Social Robots to engage autistic children and help humans with communications." - P6 CCA LEADER

##### **What's next?**

Brainstorming session
The students came together as a team and brainstormed possible problems that could be solved with social robots. 

They assigned roles to one another such as Group Leader, Editor, Designer and Presenter. The discussion points were recorded on the Google Jamboard. It was their first time using the platform!
Gearing up!

Everyone was motivated and excited to get started on their projects. They managed to fine-tune their problem statements and discussed probable solutions to their problems using the NAOv6 robot

Their Personal Learning Devices (PLD) enabled the students to carry out research independently, while their teammates worked on other aspects of the projects.

NAOv6 robot would help to bridge the divide by translating from one language to another.

*"Social robots can improve people's life through helping them with everyday tasks. I am empowered to learn more about social robotics." â€“ P6 CCA Leader
