## Getting Singapore making with the micro:bit
#### - article by Tinkercademy

Since the beginning of the year, we’ve been working with the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore to launch the Digital Maker Programme. The programme aims to take thousands of BBC micro:bits, fling them at anyone with a pulse, and see what awesome things people come up with. (We might have paraphrased a little here.)

In all seriousness, we do feel very strongly about the programme, and care deeply about what it’s actually trying to achieve, which is to introduce a new, meaningful kind of creative digital literacy in the public. It’s the feeling that learners get when they start coding and tinkering—of empowerment, of “hey, I can do this!”, of wanting to make something of their own—that spurs them to go on to learn more and spend hundreds of hours making ridiculous home-made arcade cabinets.

We’ve spent the better part of this year up to our knees in micro:bits and electronic parts, and we’d like to take some time to share what we’re doing for this programme.
