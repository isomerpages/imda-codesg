The desire to learn and improve oneself comes from the individual. But what can be done to nurture this desire is to continually provide opportunities that are welcoming, interesting, and most of all, fun! On 15th September 2018, during Community Learning Day @Changi Simei, Changi Simei CC launched their Changi Simei Makerspace, a community digital maker space.

 

Created in collaboration with Info-Communications Media Development Authority and Micromaker, Changi Simei Makerspace is a dedicated space that allows residents to learn, tinker with, create digital projects and other DIY projects. In the greater scheme of things, these basic projects allow them to understand the basics of coding and digital making.

Community Learning Day @Changi Simei includes other activities such as training sessions on Python and Game Coding with Scratch and many more. The host for this event is Ms Jessica Tan Soon Neo, Adviser to East Coast GRC Grassroots Organisations, Member of Parliament for East Coast GRC.

*“These skills are not something you can pick up one-off after a single session. People have to keep learning to develop their knowledge. So on our part, we will continue to provide platforms and ways for them to continue learning, and to nurture their interest.”*

Similar scenes happening around the Changi Simei Community Club as the public flocked to the Python and Game Coding with Scratch booths, sharing on blockchain technology, gig economy, LinkedIn, ULeap, SkillsFuture advice, and many other programmes. Many parents sat their kids down for a dynamic and entertaining children story telling session.

The Community Club certainly was buzzing with activity at Community Learning Day @ Changi Simei as members of the public kept coming in droves and moved around each of the booths and workshops. The freedom to drift around, tinker, and explore is what gets people inspired to try new things or think up new ideas and projects.

 

Platforms like Community Learning Day @ Changi Simei and Changi Simei Makerspace serves as a platform for residents to continue their learning journey and to meet like-minded individuals. This helps in growing a community of digital citizens and makers in Singapore.
