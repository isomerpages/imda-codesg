#### Title: AI IN THE COMMUNITY - A VIA PROJECT by Jeremiah Siah 

With Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming increasingly present and important in our daily lives, it is our goal as members of St. Joseph’s Institution’s Design and Innovation Club (DI Club) CCA to raise awareness about AI and its capabilities. After attending an online sharing session by Sustainable Living Lab on AI, we memorised what we had learnt and got down to work. We decided to translate what we had learned about AI in terms of its capabilities and applications into a showcase booth featuring the Alpha Mini robot. 

We set up a booth outside the school canteen, complete with posters, signs, a laptop with AI games and of course, Alpha Mini. All CCA members played their part — some appeared in the video advertisement to inform the whole school community about the booth, while others manned the booth in shifts. I personally took on the latter role where we conducted a range of activities to help our schoolmates understand AI better. First of all, we explained the difference between robots and AI to them, then shared more in-depth information on AI. This included AI’s key identifying characteristics as well as its key domains. A common misconception that our peers had was that robotics and artificial intelligence were the same things, which we were quick to clarify. Finally, we allowed the visitors to try games like Rock Paper Scissors against an AI opponent, as well as have a go at controlling Alpha Mini through the app as well as through voice control. 

Overall, the experience was extremely enjoyable and memorable. I had lots of fun imparting my knowledge about AI to my fellow Josephians, in hope that they would be able to apply it in their day-to-day life, as well as spread the knowledge to others. This also helped deepen my understanding of AI when I shared with others. I truly realised that while tiring, such Values-In-Action opportunities are precious learning opportunities which can be hard to come by. I am glad that I made full use of this particular opportunity to learn and grow.
