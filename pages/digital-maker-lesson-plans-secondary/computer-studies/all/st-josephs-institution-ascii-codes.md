Students learn about ASCII codes and their use in computing. They write a program on the microbit to show uppercase letters of the alphabet when button A of the microbit is pressed and lowercase letters of the alphabet when button B of the microbit is pressed. Buttons A and B will follow their own sequence and start from the letter A and a respectively and move onto the next letter every time the buttons are pressed.
