Our secondary 2 students are introduced to microbit programming in their third D&T lesson. They have to incorporate the microbit micro-controller into a display stand which is their D&T project. The students will then choose a programme out of three (countdown timer, magic crystal ball or digital watch) for the microbit after they have gone through 2 lessons on microbit programming.
