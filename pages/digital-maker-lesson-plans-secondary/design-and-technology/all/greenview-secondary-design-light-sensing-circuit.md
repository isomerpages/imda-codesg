Students will have the opportunity to learn through hands-on activity. They will learn how to recognise various types of components and understand the operation of a simple transistor-based light sensing circuit. At the end of the lesson, students would be able to identify different types of basic electronic components, understand the function of a simple transistor-based light sensing circuit. They would be able to understand that similar function can be obtained by replacing transistor and resistors with simply a microprocessor, and that using a microprocessor can simplify the overall circuit, while reducing the number of electronic components to be used and the ability to add in more features.

**You Will Need:**

* 1 x micro:bit electronic kit set

* 1 x micro:bit board

* 1 x PC with internet access

* 1 x LED

* Connecting wires and resistors
