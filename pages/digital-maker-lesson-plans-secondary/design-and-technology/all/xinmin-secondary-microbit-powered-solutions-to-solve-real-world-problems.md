Students will identify a possible project using the micro-bit. They will understand the concept of system block diagram and use it to define their design task. With the hands-on sessions on 5-10 micro-bit projects that have been plugged onto physical inputs and outputs components, the students can explore possibilities for their projects using the sample scripts, input and output components.

**You Will Need:**

* 5-10 x projects with sample scripts

* 1 x Lesson slides (attached)

* 1 x Sketchbook

* 1 x Needs Analysis Worksheet
