The aim of the lesson is to investigate how light and dark colors, and surface texture, affect the rate of emission of thermal energy, using microbit as a temperature sensor.  The difference in the temperatures displayed and recorded will allow students to understand how the choice of color affects the rate of emission of infra-red radiation.
