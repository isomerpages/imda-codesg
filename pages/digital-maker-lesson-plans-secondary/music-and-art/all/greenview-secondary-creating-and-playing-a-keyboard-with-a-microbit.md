Students will use the micro:bit and some materials to create their own keyboard in groups of 4. They will program the micro:bit to play different notes, and further expand their keyboards' functions to include intervals, chords and adjustment of tempo. Through the lessons, students will learn how to name and play all the notes of the keyboard within an octave including black keys. They will also be familiar with naming and playing the notes that make up D minor, E minor chords.
