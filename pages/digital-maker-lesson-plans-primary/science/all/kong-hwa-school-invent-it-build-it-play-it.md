Pupils will form a toy design squad of 4 or 5 members. They will take on the role of toy makers in a toy making company (Think of Mattel and Hasbro) and design a toy that makes use of magnets and is attractive, fun and creative. This project aims to engage students in the creativity and possibility of innovation. It is meant to spark the students’ investigative spirit, promote creativity, help think through problems and express their ideas through building toys. By getting students to apply scientific concepts in building the toys, it will also stimulate their interest in Science.
