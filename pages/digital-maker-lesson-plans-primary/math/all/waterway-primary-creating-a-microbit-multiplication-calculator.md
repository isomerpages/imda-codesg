This lesson is the 6th lesson of an 8 lesson package. The first 5 lessons focus on introducing the Micro:bits and the fundamentals of coding to the Primary 2 students. In this 6th lesson, students will use their knowledge acquired in the previous lessons to code their Micro:bit to work as a Multiplication Calculator.<br>
Lesson 1 – Introduction to Micro:bits<br>
Lesson 2 – Coding Fundamentals : Basic & Inputs<br>
Lesson 3 – Coding Fundamentals : Music & LEDs<br>
Lesson 4 – Coding Fundamentals : Math<br>
Lesson 5 – Coding Fundamentals : Variables<br>
Lesson 6 – Maths Multiplication Calculator Project<br>
Lesson 7 – Completion of Maths Multiplication Calculator Project<br>
Lesson 8 – Parent-Child Micro:bits Engagement Session<br>
In the last lesson, parents are invited to the school for a Parent-Child Micro:bits Engagement Session. Students will guide their parents on how to code a Maths Multiplication Calculator. Parents will then use recycled materials to build a simple prototype.<br>
* Do note that these P2 students have been exposed to block coding with Lego WeDo and Wonder Workshop Dash & Dot.
