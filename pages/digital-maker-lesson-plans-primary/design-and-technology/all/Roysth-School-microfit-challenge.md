Primary 4 students were taught the importance of keeping themselves healthy by clocking a certain number of steps per day during their PE lessons. They were brought to the computer labs during their PE lessons to learn how to code the Microbit and turn it into a steps counter. Students were then allowed to bring home the Microbit for a week to record the number of steps they took in a day. They provided their class monitor with the statistics and the class with the highest average number of steps per day per student wins the challenge.
