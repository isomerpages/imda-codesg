P6 Students will go through a programme to have an understanding of what programming is about as they watch videos and go through a tutorial game to grasp the basics. They will be exposed to the hardware and software used to program the <Please insert a photo here that is representative of the lesson idea. This photo will be used as the micro:bits.

The choice of product stems from a real-life problem, e.g. Christmas greetings and warnings on LED panels.
