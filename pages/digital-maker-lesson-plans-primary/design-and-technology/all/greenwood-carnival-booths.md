As part of the Greenwood Primary School’s LLP-WHIZZ programme, the P4 pupils worked on the Project Work task to design a booth for the school’s annual carnival, Celebrating Owlets. During the 2 week Project Work, pupils used various Thinking Tools to ideate and design carnival booths. Afterwhich, 10 groups of pupils were identified to integrate microbits in their booths design so as to infuse technology in their booth.
