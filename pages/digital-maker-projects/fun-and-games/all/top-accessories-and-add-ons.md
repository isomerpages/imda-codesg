The BBC launched the Micro:Bit single-board microcontroller back in 2015 as an education tool for kids in an effort to get them actively involved in writing software and project development. While the development board is a big hit with kids, it’s equally popular with makers of all ages and has been used as the foundation in creating a myriad of great projects- from musical instruments to weather stations.

Like any other development board, the Micro:Bit can make use of add-ons and accessories to increase its capabilities and expand project applications. While other boards such as the Raspberry Pi and Arduino have a vast range of plugin modules and components over the Micro:Bit, it still has a respectable repository of hardware to enhance its application spread. With that in mind, we’ll take a look at some of the add-ons and accessories that can be had for the tiny development microcontroller.
