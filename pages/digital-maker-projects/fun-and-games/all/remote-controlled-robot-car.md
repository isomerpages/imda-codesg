This project focuses on using the feature of Mirco:bit such as Radio, Accelerometer, Buttons and LED features to remotely control the robot car.

 
Titling the Mirco:bit allows us to use as a remote control to send the command using radio to the other micro:bit in the robot car.

Pressing the buttons will trigger special events such as switching on the robot car’s lights or playing a music tune.
