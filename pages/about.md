Code@SG is an initiative by Infocomm Media Development Authority to develop computational thinking and making as a national capability in Singapore.
Various programmes are run in schools and community that reach out to students and adults.  By providing them with opportunities to try a myriad of coding and making technologies, we are shaping a generation of digital innovators and creators who are passionate in using technology to solve real-world problems.<br>

#### Understanding Computational Thinking and Making<br>
Computational thinking describes the processes and approaches we draw on when thinking about how a computer can help us to solve complex problems and create systems.  There are four aspects to computational thinking: <br>

While Computational Thinking focuses on the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions, Computational Making focuses more on the Do-It-Yourself culture of making with technology, as well as the involvement of a wider social network in co-creating. <br> 

Computational Making involves physical computing, which is the designing and building of interactive systems that use different software and hardware to sense and respond to the physical world around us, integrating the knowledge of electronics, engineering and even craft skills like sewing, drawing or carving.  It helps to develop the additional skills of aesthetics, creativity, constructing, visualizing multiple representations and understanding materials, which are essential in fostering design and inventive thinking skills. <br>

#### Why Computational Thinking and Making?<br>
Whether or not someone decides to take up an infocomm media career, these are important skills to have as it allows students and adults to develop structured ways to approach and think about problems.   More importantly, as the world becomes more connected and powered by technology, itâ€™s essential to have the know-how and the creative confidence to use technology to innovate and build solutions to solve real-world problems.<br>
