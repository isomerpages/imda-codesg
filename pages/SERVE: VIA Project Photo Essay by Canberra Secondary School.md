### Title: NAOv6 Robot to the Rescue! submitted by Digital Artisans Club ### 

##### **The Journey** 
Our group of Primary 6 students embarked on the Emerging Tech X VIA project.

Through the completion of this project, they would become the tech ambassadors for emerging technologies.
The students were extremely excited to embark on the project.

The project started off with a virtual workshop by the instructor on Social Robotics. The students were exposed to how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be applied in a variety of settings to engage with people and impact their lives.

*"I enjoyed this VIA project. I like how I can make use of Social Robots to engage autistic children and help humans with communications." - P6 CCA LEADER

#### **What's next?**

**Brainstorming session**

The students came together as a team and brainstormed possible problems that could be solved with social robots. They assigned roles to one another such as Group Leader, Editor, Designer and Presenter. The discussion points were recorded on the Google Jamboard. It was their first time using the platform!

The above team decided to focus on helping children with autism. The NAOv6 robot would be programmed to interact with children with autism and teach them social skills.

The other team chose to focus on tackling the issue of language barriers between grandparents and their grandchildren.

NAOv6 robot would help to bridge the divide by translating from one language to another.

**Gearing up!**

Everyone was motivated and excited to get started on their projects. They managed to fine-tune their problem statements and discussed probable solutions to their problems using the NAOv6 robot

Their Personal Learning Devices (PLD) enabled the students to carry out research independently, while their teammates worked on other aspects of the projects.

**Preparation**

The students spent weeks fine-tuning the contents of their sharing or video presentation. They were so tech-savvy! They leveraged Google Slides to work on the presentation collaboratively in real time with their team members. Their video editing skills were put to the test as they experimented with using a green screen and other video effects.

Using their Personal Learning Devices (PLD), all team members worked concurrently to edit their presentations.

**Adding the fun element**

What's a presentation without gamification? The students who shared with their peers collectively agreed to include the Kahoot component to check on their peers' understanding. The team even tried it amongst themselves and had a fun time. They even tried troubleshooting when they encountered a technical issue with their Kahoot quiz.

Teamwork really makes a dream team!

**Show Time!**

The students presented via Zoom to their peers during curriculum time. Videos of their interaction with the NAOv6 robot were shown during recess time. An SLS learning package was also created to allow their peers to continue with their learning online.

Saving the best for the last! All the teams had the opportunity to meet with the NAOv6 robot during one of their CCA sessions. The teams interacted with the robot to test out their proposed solutions. They played the role of the end user to test the effectiveness of the social robot in tackling the problems they came up with.
