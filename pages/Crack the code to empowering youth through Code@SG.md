### Crack the code to empowering youth through Code@SG

How do you decide if you should cross a road without traffic lights? You would likely consider the distance you would need to cover, the speed at which you walk, and whether there are any oncoming cars. You might have even thought about previous experiences and outcomes before deciding to cross.

This process of decision-making—done consciously or otherwise—is an example of computational thinking, Gary Chua, a teacher at Rulang Primary School (RLPS), explains. 

**Entering the digital world with Code@SG**

To help students appreciate computational thinking and emerging technologies, and be excited about the possibilities and opportunities brought about by tech, the 
Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) launched Code@SG.

The aim is to build a foundation of computational thinking skills and offer students exclusive hands-on industry experiences and avenues to pick up emerging tech skills such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.Introduction to these skills can start as early as primary school through the Code for Fun Enrichment programme. This is jointly offered by IMDA and the Ministry of Education (MOE) to both MOE primary and secondary schools and is an opportunity for students to learn about computational thinking, coding and digital making.

Gary, who is a Code for Fun teacher, believes that there are many benefits of picking up these skills early. “Computational thinking refers to a set of problem-solving skills that emulates the computer’s way of solving problems,” he explains. “It’s about recognising a problem, breaking that problem into chunks, looking for patterns, focusing on the root of the problem and then developing the steps to solve it.”

Thus, computational thinking is a suitable framework for problem-solving across all facets of life, and not just in the world of coding and computing.

So, how does Code@SG crack the code to get youth interested in these relevant skills?

It starts from addressing any fear that the students may have. After all, the term computational thinking can be intimidating simply because it sounds like a “big word”, Gary shares.

“But when we understand the process, it’s actually very simple and when we break down the steps, students realise they’ve seen parts of it before,” he adds.
