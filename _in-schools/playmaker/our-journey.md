In 2016, PlayMaker was piloted at 160 pre-schools in Singapore, giving pre-schoolers an early exposure to computational thinking and robotics with age- and developmentally-appropriate technology. Robotics offers a playful and collaborative way for children to engage with foundational technology and engineering concepts during their formative early childhood years. Young children are inspired to create with technology, experiment, fail and try again, imbuing them with the confidence to be creative.
