The PlayMaker programme introduces child-friendly, technology-enabled toys that promote tactile and more kinaesthetic experiences.  These toys help children to explore and find creative solutions.  Guided by adults, children will acquire abilities like logical thinking, reasoning, sequencing, estimation and inventive thinking. The toys also encourage children to work in small groups. Through collaboration, they develop social and communication skills.

The following are examples of age-appropriate and developmentally-appropriate technology-enabled toys that require little or no screen time.
