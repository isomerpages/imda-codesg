#### The ICM (Infocomm Media) Learning Roadmap serves as a guide in structuring progressive ICM training in various functional domains. 


This will be helpful for all teachers-in-charge running Infocomm Clubs and also for interested students who aspire towards particular roles in ICM.

As an overview, the roadmap covers 8 roadmaps under 4 functional domain areas of Application Development, Cyber Security, Data Analytics and Robotics & Makers.

The core roadmap will allow students to better appreciate different facets of ICM through a progressive set of ICM-related activities.
