The Code For Fun Programme allows pupils to:
-	Learn about core computational thinking concepts and how it can be applied to aspects of daily life;
-	Understand basic programming concepts such as debugging, events, loops, variables, functions and conditionals;
-	Develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills by breaking down problems into bite-sizes through mini-challengesâ€™ and
-	Be introduced to emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (A.I) concepts such as What is Machine Learning, why are Data Sets important and how A.I makes decisions.
