The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme (offered jointly by IMDA and MOE) is offered to all MOE primary and secondary schools. The programme includes academic learning of related concepts using visual-based programming language, combining it with robotic kits and/or microcontrollers, to create a coding experience for the students.

<br> The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme aims to:
* Facilitate the exposure of a large base of students to coding and computational thinking; and
* Help build an entire generation of workforce inculcated with basic coding and computational thinking skills. <br>
