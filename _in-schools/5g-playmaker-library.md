#### PlayMaker Library

IMDA is setting up a PlayMaker library for pre-schools to borrow tech toys for a short period of time and use them during curriculum hours. 

These tech toys will support pre-school educators to put into practice what they have learnt, integrating technology into their lessons and introducing Computational Thinking to their students. 

New and emerging tech toys that are suitable for the pre-schoolers will be curated and added to the PlayMaker library for pre-schools to borrow. 

Look out for more information on the loan eligibility and details in April 2020.
