## LEARN: Broad Based Training and Deep Skills Acquisition

As part of IMDA’s LEARN menu, Infocomm Media Club members will be provided training in various infocomm and media domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Game Development and Mobile App Development. The intent is to spark passion for tech and media skills acquisition.

LEARN covers two training modes:

**LEARN Roadmaps**
<br>These broad-based courses are held during CCA hours at the school’s premises. Teachers-in-charge will choose the courses suitable for their Clubs and apply to IMDA. This Info Kit will cover the application process and the course offerings for LEARN Roadmap in 2023.

**LEARN Bootcamps & Accelerators**
<br>These fast-tracked industry-backed learning courses are held outside of school curriculum hours, at external premises.
