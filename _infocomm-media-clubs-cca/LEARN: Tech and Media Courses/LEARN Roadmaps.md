## LEARN Roadmaps
LEARN Roadmaps are structured, broad-based training courses held during CCA hours at MOE school premises. Specifically tailored for Infocomm Media Club students, these courses help develop basic skills in topics across tech and media domains such as Artificial Intelligence, Game Development and New Media.

IMDA partners with industry leaders to develop industry-backed learning roadmaps to develop proficiency in the domain through the partners’ materials and platform. To cater to different interests, IMDA also offers tech and media courses in a broad spectrum of topics through our training partners.

Each MOE school is supported with up to 2 courses annually, where the training cost is fully funded by IMDA. Where hardware is required, schools can work with the training providers or other vendors to procure the hardware at their own expense.
