## DISCOVER: Out of Classroom Learning Experiences

Taking learning out of the classroom is important to augment membersâ€™ in-class lessons to provide exposure to how tech and media are applied in the industry. IMDA curates bite-sized learning journeys (such as company visits) for members to have first-hand experiences to interact with the technologies, as well as with the professionals in the various industries to better understand the real-world applications of tech and media.
