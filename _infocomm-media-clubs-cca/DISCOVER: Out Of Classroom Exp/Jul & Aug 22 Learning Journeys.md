Immersive technology will transform the way we live, work, learn, and experience entertainment in a brand-new way. 

Join us at one of Singaporeâ€™s largest VR parks and put on virtual reality (VR) headsets to embark on larger-than-life adventures like braving rapids on a jungle raft or riding a dog sled through an unrelenting blizzard. Through these thematic VR experiences, learn how the technology works and discover its potential applications across varied fields and industries.
