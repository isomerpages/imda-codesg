The **Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)** and **Google** will be launching a brand-new **national tech competition** for Infocomm Media Clubs this **July**, taking place at **Google**.

In this new format, teams will be trained and can put their tech skills to the test to compete against other teams in solving a series of hands-on challenges designed by Google each week. The competition will be part of an online web series, in episodic form that would be released during/after the competition. Details of the competition and web series will be announced in the next mailer.

**Registration opens in early May** and hereâ€™s what you can do to get a head start for the competition:

* Start forming a team to represent your school. Each school may register one team of five students. (No prior coding experience is required and students will get to learn new skills as part of the competition process)
