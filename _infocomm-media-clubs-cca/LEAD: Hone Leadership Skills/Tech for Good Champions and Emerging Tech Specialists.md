## Appointment of Tech for Good Champions and Emerging Tech Specialists

To provide more opportunities for students, IMDA has minted two new leadership roles. Teachers are highly encouraged to adopt these two new roles and appoint student leaders who will serve the community and their school. 


*Both new roles will be part of the Upper Secondary CCA Executive Committee. 
* We recommend appointing students to the new roles at Secondary 2 where they will continue to serve for two years.
