## LEAD : Hone Leadership Skills

LEAD aims to inspire and equip Infocomm Media Club student leaders with skills to lead their peers and helm the running of the Club. This includes:

* Practical leadership and project management 
training

* Exposure and training in emerging tech

* Understanding of how tech can be used for good

Student leaders can also look forward to the Infocomm Media Club Student Leadership Conference to be held at the end of the year where they can interact with and learn from trailblazers in the tech and media sector.
