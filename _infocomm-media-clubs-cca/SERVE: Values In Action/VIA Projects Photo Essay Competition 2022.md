In our inaugural Emerging Tech Ã— Values-in-Action (VIA) Project held in March, 38 schools participated in training programmes that taught the Club members about Artificial Intelligence, Decentralised Technology and Social Robotics, and pass on the knowledge to their school community.

Despite the challenges of reaching out to the community, the students devised creative ways to reach out to their school community and documented the process in these photo essays to showcase what they have learnt.
