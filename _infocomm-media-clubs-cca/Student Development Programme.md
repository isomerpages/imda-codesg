### Student Development Programmes

#### The Student Development Programme aims to provide youths with various opportunities to learn relevant skills to the industry.

Through this programme, students from Infocomm Media Clubs at schools and community will be offered opportunities to deepen their technical skills , through partnerships with industry partners. Such opportunities could be in the form of internships/mentorships, accelerated training programmes, and boot camps with technology leaders and start-ups.

Information on upcoming Student Development Programmes will be released progressively in our newsletter. Check out our newsletter [here](/newsletter/) for details.
