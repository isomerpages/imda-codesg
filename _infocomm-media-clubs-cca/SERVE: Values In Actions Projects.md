## SERVE: Values-In-Action Projects

#### Members will be provided with opportunities to serve their peers and the community. IMDA has curated meaningful Values-In-Action projects where industry partners will provide the training required for members to be able to teach others confidently.

As part of the inaugural run in March, club members will receive complimentary training from one of three industry tech partners in the areas of Artificial Intelligence, Decentralised Technology and Social Robotics. 

Every club member who successfully completes the training and VIA project will receive a certificate and an exclusive enamel pin from IMDA.

Details of the VIA project can be found [here](/files/icm-learning-roadmap/VIA%20EDM%20Attachment.pdf).

You may register for the VIA projects [here](https://form.gov.sg/#!/61c41737ef72800012a47858).
