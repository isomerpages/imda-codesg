#### To provide an enriching CCA experience for Infocomm Media Club members, IMDA will be offering members with opportunities to pursue their interest, deepen their learning in emerging tech and gain industry exposure.

The curated programmes and activities in the following 5 categories take guidance from MOEâ€™s CCA LEAPS framework and provide more opportunities for club members to obtain CCA points:

* **DISCOVER**: [Out-of-Classroom Learning Experiences](/infocomm-media-clubs/discover/)
* **EXCEL**: [A National Platform to Gain Knowledge, Excel & Receive Recognition](/infocomm-media-clubs-cca/excel)

* **SERVE**: [Values-in-Action Projects](/infocomm-media-clubs/serve/)
