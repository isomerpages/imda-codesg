By Community, For Community are various ground-up projects by individuals or corporates to promote computational thinking and making for different communities. 

One of the projects is **Code in the Community (CiTC)** by IMDA and Google. It is a 3-year initiative offering free coding classes to help underprivileged students become digitally ready for the future. The coding classes will be facilitated by partners such as Saturday Kids and 21C Girls, supported by various self-help groups, community partners such as National Library Board, community centres and family service centres to provide their premises for classes to be held. 

Students from the CiTC's Level 1 Foundational programme aged between 8 and 12 years old will learn the Scratch coding language, while students aged 13 to 16 years old will learn to code in Python. There is also a follow-up Level 2 Applications programme for graduates of the foundational programme. It will incorporate a maker element to encourage students to apply their learnings, and introduce more complex concepts like design thinking to solve defined problems. Both the Level 1 Foundational and Level 2 Application programmes will be structured as a 16-hour curriculum spread across 8 weeks. 

To find out more about the programme, how you can sign up for the classes or to register as a volunteer, please click <a href="https://www.codeinthecommunity.com" target="_blank">here</a>.

Other projects are supported by **Our Singapore Fund for Digital Readiness (OSF-DR)**. It is a fund to support individuals or corporates spearhead community projects that will benefit fellow Singaporeans to become digitally ready and reap the benefits of a digital future. 

Some of the coding-related projects are shown below. For the full list of projects that are supported by OSF-DR, what the fund can support and how to apply, please click <a href="https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/our-singapore-fund-for-digital-readiness" target="_blank">here</a>. 


#### **Lighthouse Program**

**Vivita Singapore** wants to empower children with digital and making skills to create the future by providing them with an environment and access to proper guidance from industry professionals in order to inspire them, help them ideate and mentor them to co-create solutions.

In the first part of the programme, participants will receive new inspiration from forerunners and change-makers; work with other students across Singapore to brush up their ideas in facilitated ideation workshops.

Participants who are committed and keen to develop their ideas can participate in the second part of the program, where they will make and co-create with the support of industry professionals and mentors, and showcase their prototypes to the community.

#### **Tech@Shopee: Coding for Youths**


**Shopee** provides opportunities for youths from low-income families who are keen on learning coding. During the 3-hour workshop, volunteer trainers will inspire and teach youths to code and understand the importance of coding. The workshop will begin with an introduction to Coding and Python, followed by hands-on acitivities with Python and creating a Chatbot. These workshops are customized to incorporate practical elements whereby participants have the opportunity to create and build real-world solutions to real problems. 



#### **Tiny Thinkers I & II**

![Tiny Thinkers II image](/images/in-community/overview/TinyThinkersII-6.jpg)


**Tiny Thinkers I** was started by a group of NTU students to introduce computational thinking to preschool children and their parents through specially-curated games on a dedicated website, hands-on workshops to guide parents and a Starter Kit filled with materials to kickstart the preschool children’s journey in computational thinking.  

Expanding from the Tiny Thinkers I project, Unfair advantage started **Tiny Thinkers II** to include more acitivities in the Junior Computational Thinking kit to kick-start preschool children's journey in computational thinking, conduct workshops to reach out to pre-schoolers from low-income families, and keep the website updated with more activities and resources for anyone to use.

#### **Hatch Immersive**

![Hatch Immersive image](/images/in-community/overview/Hatch-Immersive-1.png)


**Hatch Immersive** targets youths from low-income, dropout, and at-risk backgrounds and brings them through a 1-month comprehensive training that comprise technical skills in either UI,UX Design or Digital Marketing, workplace skills and industry exposure. These provides them with the essential skills to enter the workforce and become independent. Upon successful completion of the training, youths will be given a 3-month internship opportunity in one of the partner companies. At the end of the internship, the youths would either convert to full-time or pursue further education. 

These Hatch Workshops target secondary school students who may not be excelling academically or are identified by the teachers to be “long-term absent”, to provide students with exposure to skills-based jobs and to build their self-confidence to secure these jobs.

#### **Engineering Good**

![Engineering Good](/images/in-community/overview/Engineering-Good-4.png)


**Engineering Good** conducted a **Tech for Good Festival** on 2nd November 2019 which celebrated how technology can help make life better for people with disabilities. Participants took part in workshops by Engineering Good and our partners, and learnt how they were able to help. Additionally, they also viewed a showcase of inventions by the Tech For Good contestants and partners. 

Additionally, Engineering Group is also conducting **“We Hack Care!” workshops** where participants will learn how to DIY low-cost assistive devices through simple engineering and donate the modified devices to VWOs and Special education schools (SPEDs) to support them in their training and daily activities.
